#   a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - and _

# This is the key shared between httun-client and httun-server
# for encryption and authentication of the data and control traffic.

# Keep this private.
# Anybody with knowledge of this secret can connect to the httun tunnel.

# This ensures that the secret is truly random and secure.
